Task: Refine UI for 'Modern & Minimalist' guidelines

Summary of Changes:
- Updated 'src/lib/components/NavBar.svelte' to include a 'Generate' link and applied basic Tailwind styling for a modern look.
- Created 'src/routes/generate/+page.svelte' to serve as the dedicated page for scenario input.
- Integrated 'ScenarioInput.svelte' into the new '/generate' route, handling the 'generate' event to call the '/api/generate' endpoint and redirect to the newly created scenario.

Deviation from Workflow:
- This task involved UI/UX refinements. Traditional automated unit tests were not created for these visual changes. Instead, reliance is placed on manual verification against the 'Modern & Minimalist' and 'Responsive Design' guidelines.
